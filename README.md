# BipsNet
Blockchain Based Instant Property Network

**What is BipsNet?** 

BipsNet is a digitally native property marketplace to be built on a blockchain-based platorm which enables all participants involved in property rental, buying and selling process to join up their business processes using smart contracts to instantly make transactions directly, thereby cutting transaction time, business process complexity, risk and cost of buying and selling property and property rental.

**Why Us and Why we do it?** 

Property business, like any other business, globally have grown organically from paper-based foundations, which means that even with technology they remain complex, slow, inefficient and risk laden for commercial and retail participants. These inefficiencies are becoming increasingly intolerable to regulators, consumers, and businesses within the ecosystem.

**Our Market Niche**

We have carefully carved our niche in Sub-Saharan Africa, to pilot particularly from Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, major cities like Abuja, Kano and Lagos-Nigeria, where there is a massive urban migration and a huge Housing deficit. 
According to the World Bank Group's Acting VP for Africa, "_Stocktaking of the Housing Sector in Sub-Saharan Africa, projects that Africa could have as many as 1.2 billion urban dwellers by 2050 and 4.5 million new residents in informal settlements each year, most of whom cannot afford basic formal housing or access mortgage loans. Governments will need to join hands with the private sector to facilitate investments in housing by expanding access to and improving the quality of existing stock, while at the same time making it easier for people to access land and housing finance_" . 1

**Who is BipsNet for?**

BipsNet is for individuals desiring to rent, own or sell a property, mortgage institutions, Housing authorities, estate developers and agents, tax authorities.
We hope to complete our first MVP iteration as soon as we can for proper testing to emphasize the potential of new blockchain-based system to ease and speed up property transactions.
